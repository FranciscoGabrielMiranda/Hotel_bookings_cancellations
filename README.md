# Booking Cancellation Case Study
* A significant number of hotel bookings are called off because of cancellations and no-shows.
* Revenue losses can be high when free cancellation options or low cost penalties apply, particularly on last-minute cancellations. 
* A dataset containing information of hotel bookings is used to build ML models to predict cancellations.
* A logistic regression and a decision tree help to find the factors affecting the bookings cancellations.
